# SinglePhase-Flow-FDM
This project aims at simulating single phase flow inside a 2D rentangular channel. To achieve this, the finite difference method as a predictor-corrector algorithm has been implemented.

NOTE: Please copy NS_initial_conditions_Ux.npy and NS_initial_conditions_Uy.npy to the directory where NS_FDM.py is situated.
